# Gradle Wrapper JAR Placeholder
# 
# This file is normally a binary JAR file that contains the Gradle wrapper.
# In a real Android project, this would be downloaded automatically when you
# run the Gradle wrapper for the first time.
#
# To get the actual gradle-wrapper.jar:
# 1. Install Android Studio
# 2. Create a new Android project
# 3. Copy the gradle-wrapper.jar from that project
# 4. Or run: gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.4
#
# For now, this is just a placeholder to complete the project structure.
